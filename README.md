# Sudoku make in Python using GTK.
This is a project I made in order to expand my knowledge in GTK and exercise my Algorithm Design capabilities.  
By using Cairo as a renderer, I also solved an issue where interacting with the app caused the dGPU to wake up,  
thus causing lag-spikes whenever the system changed between the Hybrid and Integrated graphics on my machine.
